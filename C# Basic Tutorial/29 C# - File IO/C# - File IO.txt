C# - File I/O



A file is a collection of data stored in a disk with a specific name and a directory path. When a file is opened for reading or writing, it becomes a stream.

The stream is basically the sequence of bytes passing through the communication path. There are two main streams: the input stream and the output stream. The input stream is used for reading data from file (read operation) and the output stream is used for writing into the file (write operation).


The FileStream Class
The FileStream class in the System.IO namespace helps in reading from, writing to and closing files. This class derives from the abstract class Stream.



1 FileMode

The FileMode enumerator defines various methods for opening files. The members of the FileMode enumerator are −

Append − It opens an existing file and puts cursor at the end of file, or creates the file, if the file does not exist.

Create − It creates a new file.

CreateNew − It specifies to the operating system, that it should create a new file.

Open − It opens an existing file.

OpenOrCreate − It specifies to the operating system that it should open a file if it exists, otherwise it should create a new file.

Truncate − It opens an existing file and truncates its size to zero bytes.




2 FileAccess

FileAccess enumerators have members: Read, ReadWrite and Write.




3 FileShare

FileShare enumerators have the following members −

Inheritable − It allows a file handle to pass inheritance to the child processes

None − It declines sharing of the current file

Read − It allows opening the file for readin.

ReadWrite − It allows opening the file for reading and writing

Write − It allows opening the file for writing
