C# - Type Conversion


Type conversion is converting one type of data to another type. It is also known as Type Casting. In C#, type casting has two forms 

Implicit type conversion : These conversions are performed by C# in a type-safe manner. For example, are conversions from smaller to larger integral types and conversions from derived classes to base classes.

Explicit type conversion : These conversions are done explicitly by users using the pre-defined functions. Explicit conversions require a cast operator.
