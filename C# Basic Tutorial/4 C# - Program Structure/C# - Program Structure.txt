C# - Program Structure


Creating Hello World Program

using System;
namespace HelloWorldApplication {
   class HelloWorld {
      static void Main(string[] args) {
         /* my first program in C# */
         Console.WriteLine("Hello World");
         Console.ReadKey();
      }
   }
}


Various parts of the program :

                  Using keyword is used to include the System namespace in the program.
                  
                  A namespace is a collection of classes.
                  
                  class declaration, the class HelloWorld contains the data and method definitions that your program uses.
                  HelloWorld class has only one method Main
                  
                  Main method, which is the entry point for all C# programs. The Main method states what the class does when executed.
                  
                  /*...*/ is ignored by the compiler and it is put to add comments in the program.
                  
                  WriteLine is a method of the Console class defined in the System namespace. This statement causes the message "Hello, World!" to be displayed on the screen.
                  
                  Console.ReadKey(); is for the VS.NET Users. This makes the program wait for a key press and it prevents the screen from running and closing quickly when the program is launched from Visual Studio .NET.




It is worth to note the following points 

              C# is case sensitive.
              
              All statements and expression must end with a semicolon (;).
              
              The program execution starts at the Main method.
              
              Unlike Java, program file name could be different from the class name.
