C# - Variables


Variable : Its nothing but a name given to a storage area that our programs can manipulate.

    C# also allows defining other value types of variable such as enum and reference types of variables such as class, which we will cover in subsequent chapters.


Lvalue and Rvalue Expressions in C#
    THERE ARE TWO KINDS OF EXPRESSIONS IN C# ?
    
    LVALUE ? AN EXPRESSION THAT IS AN LVALUE MAY APPEAR AS EITHER THE LEFT-HAND OR RIGHT-HAND SIDE OF AN ASSIGNMENT.
    
    RVALUE ? AN EXPRESSION THAT IS AN RVALUE MAY APPEAR ON THE RIGHT- BUT NOT LEFT-HAND SIDE OF AN ASSIGNMENT.
    
    VARIABLES ARE LVALUES AND HENCE THEY MAY APPEAR ON THE LEFT-HAND SIDE OF AN ASSIGNMENT. NUMERIC LITERALS ARE RVALUES AND HENCE THEY MAY NOT BE ASSIGNED AND CAN NOT APPEAR ON THE LEFT-HAND SIDE. FOLLOWING IS A VALID C# STATEMENT ?
    
    INT G = 20;
    BUT FOLLOWING IS NOT A VALID STATEMENT AND WOULD GENERATE COMPILE-TIME ERROR ?
    
    10 = 20;
