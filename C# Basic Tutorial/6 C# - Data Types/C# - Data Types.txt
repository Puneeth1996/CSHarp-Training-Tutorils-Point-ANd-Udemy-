C#- Data Types


To get the exact size of a type or a variable on a particular platform, you can use the sizeof method. 


 
To get the exact size of a type or a variable on a particular platform, you can use the          sizeof();                 method. There is an example in the same folder with name            sizeOf

 
REFERENCE TYPE: Refer to a memory location

Example of built-in reference types are: object, dynamic, and string.


          
          1 OBJECT TYPE: When a value type is converted to object type, it is called boxing and on the other hand, when an object type is converted to a value type, it is called unboxing.
          
          object obj;
          obj = 100; // this is boxing
          
          
          
          
          
          2 DYNAMIC TYPE: You can store any type of value in the dynamic data type variable.
          Syntax for declaring a dynamic type is as shown below:
          
          dynamic <variable_name> = value;
          For example,
          
          dynamic d = 20;
          
          
          
          3 STRING TYPE: The String Type allows you to assign any string values to a variable.
          
          For example,
          
          String str = "Tutorials Point";
          A @quoted string literal looks as follows 
          
          @"Tutorials Point";
          
          
          
          4 POINTER TYPE: Pointer type variables store the memory address of another type.
          
          Syntax for declaring a pointer type is as shown below
          
          type* identifier;
          For example,
          
          char* cptr;
          int* iptr;
