C# - Basic Syntax



In Object-Oriented Programming methodology, a program consists of various objects that interact with each other by means of actions. The actions that an object may take are called methods.



Identifiers
        An identifier is a name used to identify a class, variable, function, or any other user-defined item. The basic rules for naming classes in C# are as follows 
        
        A name must begin with a letter that could be followed by a sequence of letters, digits (0 - 9) or underscore. The first character in an identifier cannot be a digit.
        
        It must not contain any embedded space or symbol such as? - + ! @ # % ^ & * ( ) [ ] { } . ; : " ' / and \. However, an underscore ( _ ) can be used.
        
        It should not be a C# keyword.


C# Keywords
          keywords are reserved words predefined to the c# compiler. these keywords cannot be used as identifiers. however, if you want to use these keywords as identifiers, you may prefix the keyword with the @ character.
          
          in c#, some identifiers have special meaning in context of code, such as get and set are called contextual keywords.
