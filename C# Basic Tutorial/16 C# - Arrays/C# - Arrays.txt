C# - Arrays



Declaring Arrays: 	
datatype[] arrayName;	eg:		double[] balance;


Initializing an Array:
double[] balance = new double[10];




Assigning Values to an Array:
1
double[] balance = new double[10];
balance[0] = 4500.0;

2
You can assign values to the array at the time of declaration, as shown −
double[] balance = { 2340.0, 4523.69, 3421.0};

3
You can also create and initialize an array, as shown −
int [] marks = new int[5]  { 99,  98, 92, 97, 95};

4
You may also omit the size of the array, as shown −
int [] marks = new int[]  { 99,  98, 92, 97, 95};


5
You can copy an array variable into another target array variable. In such case, both the target and source point to the same memory location −
int [] marks = new int[]  { 99,  98, 92, 97, 95};
int[] score = marks;


Accessing Array Elements
double salary = balance[9];
