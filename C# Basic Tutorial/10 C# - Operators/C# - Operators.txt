An OPERATOR is a symbol that tells the compiler to perform specific mathematical or logical manipulations.
following type of operators 

    Arithmetic Operators
    Relational Operators
    Logical Operators
    Bitwise Operators
    Assignment Operators
    Misc Operators

Bitwise Operators

Eg:
    Assume if A = 60; and B = 13; then in the binary format they are as follows ?
    
    A = 0011 1100
    
    B = 0000 1101
    
    -------------------
    
    A&B = 0000 1100
    
    A|B = 0011 1101
    
    A^B = 0011 0001(XOR)
    
    ~A  = 1100 0011
